### Problem 1: Dog Constructor
Design a class called Dog.  Implement a constructor that initializes the instance variables of a Dog object.  Specify what instance variables you think are appropriate for a Dog (e.g., name, breed, age).

### Problem 2: Rectangle Constructors (Overloading)
Create a class named Rectangle.  Implement constructor overloading for this class.
- Create one constructor that accepts the rectangle's length and width as arguments.
- Create a second constructor that accepts only the side length of a square as an argument. This constructor should initialize the Rectangle object as a square (equal length and width).

### Problem 3: Person Class with Default Constructor and this()
Develop a class called Person.
- Implement a default constructor (a constructor with no arguments) for this class. Consider what default values would be appropriate for the instance variables of a Person object.
- Use the this() keyword within a second constructor (that takes arguments) to call the default constructor. Explain why using this() is beneficial in this scenario.

### Problem 4: Student Class and the Copy Constructor
Design a class called Student.  Include a member variable that lists courses the student is enrolled in.
- Implement a copy constructor for the Student class.
- Explain the difference between a deep copy and a shallow copy in the context of this Student class. Why is a deep copy essential when dealing with mutable data like the list of courses? Demonstrate how your copy constructor creates a deep copy.
