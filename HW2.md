### Problem 1
Basic Constructor (Dog):  Demonstrates a simple constructor that initializes the instance variables of a Dog object.

### Problem 2
Constructor Overloading (Rectangle): How to create multiple constructors with different parameters (overloading).  One constructor creates a rectangle with a given length and width, and another makes a square (rectangle with equal sides) with a given side length.

### Problem 3
Default Constructor and this() (Person):  Illustrates the use of a default constructor (a constructor with no arguments). The this() keyword is used to call another constructor within the same class, avoiding code duplication.

### Problem 4
Copy Constructor (Student):  Explains how to create a copy constructor. This is crucial to avoid unintended side effects when working with objects that contain mutable data (like the courses listed in this example). The copy constructor creates a deep copy of the list, ensuring that changes to the list in the copied object don't affect the original object.  A shallow copy would copy the reference to the list so that both objects would share the same list.
